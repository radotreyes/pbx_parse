# Different DATA EXTRACTION SETS are separated by
COMMAND: [command]

- If COMMAND: isn't followed by anything then ignore it.

# Files that work with the current model:

	NORMAL:

	- ATC (PK: PAD) (Command: LI ATC ALL)
	- ATC_G (PK: GROUP NUMBER) (Command: LI ATC_G ALL)
	- COM_GROUP (PK: COM GROUP) (Command: LI COM_G ALL)
	- EXPECTED_DIGITS (PK: TABLE) (Command: LI EXPECTED_DIGITS ALL)

	"ALIGN-FIXED":

	- TRUNK_GROUPS (PK: GENERAL ATTRIBUTES (1)) (Command: LI TRUNK_GROUP ALL)

	MULTIPLE COMMANDS:
	- ACD_G (PK: ACDGROUP NODE) (Command: LI ACD_G ALL)

	
# Files that almost work:
	- ROUTE_LISTS (PK: ROUTE LIST NAME) (Command: LI ROUTE_LIST ALL)
		(need to include data from PK)
	- SERVICE_LIST (PK: SERVICE AREA NAME) (Command: LI SERVICE_LIST ALL)
		(need to include data from PK)

# Files that don't work, and adjustments:
	- CALLPROCESSING (PK: Mailbox Extn) (No command, completely different format)


## DATA SHIFTED DOWN PATTERNS:
	- Data is shifted DOWN one line and LEFT two columns.
	- Apply an alignment fix to specified fields.

self.data

			"**ENTRY#:" num:

SPREADSHEET:
------------
R1 -> fields
R2 -> first set
R3 -> second set
.

.
Rn -> nth set


IDENTIFYING BY FIELDS:
----------------------
field_names (nested list) = [
	[field1],
	[field2],
	.
	.
	.
}


``` WRITING TO SPREADSHEET ```
1. _FOREACH_ set, 
	a. count the size, _len()_, of each member and reserve that number of rows in the spreadsheet.
	b. assign each field in the entry to an appropriate column.

```

##########
9/7: Works as intended, but sets are being pushed to the next member[] for some reason. probably an issue where data is being pushed to member[] early, and/or member[] is not being cleared before pushing a new data set to it.
